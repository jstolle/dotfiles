the-dot-files
=============

These are my dot files (or most of them)

Just link each of these to your ${HOME} directory to put them to use.

These are where the files originally came from:

-   Xdefaults

    Entirely plagiarized from [anrxc][1] (Thank you!)

-   Xmodmap

    Cobbled together myself.

-   tmux.conf

    This is from [dotphiles][2]. I haven't tinkered on it yet.

-   zshrc

    Entirely plagiarized from [anrxc][3] again (Thank you again!)

-   dir_colors

    A dump from <code>dircolors -p</code> for now

-   conkerorrc

    I don't remember where I got this, but I know I've added to it.  Also,
    Instapaper and the RSS subscription aren't working.
