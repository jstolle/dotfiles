the-dot-files
=============

These are my dot files (or most of them)

These are where the files originally came from:

-   Xdefaults

    Entirely plagiarized from [anrxc][1] (Thank you!)

-   Xmodmap

    Cobbled together myself.

-   tmux.conf

    This is from [dotphiles][2]. I haven't tinkered on it yet.

-   zshrc

    Entirely plagiarized from [anrxc][3] again (Thank you again!)
